4. Confettie Drop on win -  https://codepen.io/jonathanbell/pen/OvYVYw
    I Found some code online that drops confettie when the player wins.
    I had to make a number of changes to integrate it into the system.  Created a function to turn it on and off. Adjusted the z-index. I had to create a variable that tracked if the game was active or not to decide to show it or not.  

5. Title Text Letters
    I thought it would be cool to have the letters of the title act like the letters in the game and blink in and out.  I'm good with CSS so i was able to get the block letter styling pretty quickly.  I spent a lot of time working on making the text responsive, which had some challenges considering each letter is in it's own div. 
    
    The setInterval functionality was realtively new to me.  I had do a lot of reading and testing to figure it out.  
    
    I utilized the same functionality as in the game; like generating a random number to index the letters and looping through different letters in the html.


6.  Guessing page
    Added a Theme: Javascript Puns
    Changed buttons to white
    Created a box around the keyboard to give it more of a keyboard feel
    Added color to the background
